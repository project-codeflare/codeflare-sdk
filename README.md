An intuitive, easy-to-use python interface for batch resource requesting, access, job submission, and observation. Simplifying the developer's life while enabling access to high-performance compute resources, either in the cloud or on-prem.

For guided demos and basics walkthroughs, check out the following links:

- Guided demo notebooks available [here](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk/tree/main/demo-notebooks/guided-demos), and copies of the notebooks with [expected output](https://github.com/project-codeflare/codeflare-sdk/tree/main/demo-notebooks/guided-demos/notebook-ex-outputs) also available
- these demos can be copied into your current working directory when using the `codeflare-sdk` by using the `codeflare_sdk.copy_demo_nbs()` function
- Additionally, we have a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U76iIfd9EmE) of these basic demos from June, 2023

## Release Instructions

### Automated Releases

It is possible to use the Release Github workflow to do the release. This is generally the process we follow for releases

### Manual Releases

The following instructions apply when doing release manually. This may be required in instances where the automation is failing.

- Check and update the version in "pyproject.toml" file.
- Generate new documentation.
`pdoc --html -o docs src/codeflare_sdk && pushd docs && rm -rf cluster job utils && mv codeflare_sdk/* . && rm -rf codeflare_sdk && popd && find docs -type f -name "*.html" -exec bash -c "echo '' >> {}" \;` (it is possible to install **pdoc** using the following command `poetry install --with docs`)
- Commit all the changes to the repository.
- Create Github release (<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/managing-releases-in-a-repository#creating-a-release>).
- Build the Python package. `poetry build`
- If not present already, add the API token to Poetry.
`poetry config pypi-token.pypi API_TOKEN`
- Publish the Python package. `poetry publish`
